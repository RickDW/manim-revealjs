# [WIP] Manim and Reveal.js plugins for using mathematical animations in your slides

This repository contains the required plugins to use the beautiful mathematical animations that are made possible by [Manim](https://www.manim.community) in presentation slides made with [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js). Manim was originally created by Grant Sanderson from the Youtube channel [3B1B](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) which is well known its pretty and clear mathematical animations.

(This is a fork of [manim_slides](https://github.com/chubbc/manim_slides) which itself is a fork of [manim_reveal](https://github.com/anjandn/manim_reveal))

At the moment this repository is a complete work in progress and you probably won't get much use out of it. Updates are expected in the next few weeks.
