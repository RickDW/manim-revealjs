- Properly register the manim plugin?
- Make a proper revealjs plugin out of the javascript code
- New feature: allow manim animations to be used as separate video elements instead of only as slide backgrounds
- New feature: implement different types of video fragments, like the ones provided by 
    Christopher Besch's web presenter project (https://github.com/christopher-besch/manim_web_presenter)
    Types of slides: 
    - normal (start->end)
    - no-pause (start->end->next fragment)
    - loop (start->end->start->...)
    - complete loop (start->end->start->request for next fragment->end->next fragment)
